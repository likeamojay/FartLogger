# FartLogger

Simple, fun iOS App to track your flatulence throughout the day. Simply launch the app, navigate to Record Session, and begin tracking. As you pass gas, your log will be updated in real time for reference. FartLogger uses a machine-learning model built from over 130 sounds to recognize the sounds of a fart. Accuracy currently clocks at about 85%.

FartLogger uses Twilio's SMS Web API to send automatic text messages to user-chosen recipients.

Plug in your Twilio Account's phone number and credentials in 3 fields in FartLogger's Info.plist file to use them for this feature. The fields are named TWILIO-PHONE-NUMBER, TWILIO-TOKEN, and TWILIO-API-KEY.
